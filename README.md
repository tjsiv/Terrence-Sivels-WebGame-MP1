## Description

This project is a recreation of the classic game Pac-Man using JavaScript and Canvas.

## Game Logic

### Player Decisions
The player can move their character around the canvas map, collecting pellets and fruit while avoiding the roaming ghosts. The player can also pause the game to take a break.

### Player Movement
The player can move their character in four directions: up, down, left, and right, using the arrow keys or designated controls.

### Winning and Losing Conditions
- **Winning:** The player wins the game by collecting all the power pellets scattered across the map.
- **Losing:** The player loses the game if their character collides with a ghost three times.

## Game Completion Indicators
- **Winning:** When all the power pellets are collected, the player is notified that they have won the game.
- **Losing:** If the player collides with a ghost three times, they are notified that they have lost the game.
- upon completion the playter can press the restart buttom and play the game again.
